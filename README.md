```

3. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages using the requirements.txt file (located in the requirements folder):
``` pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt ```

4. Run the Application
[If it's a web application (e.g., Flask/Django):]
``` # Run database migrations (if applicable)
[e.g., python manage.py migrate]

# Start the server
[e.g., python app/main.py or flask run or python manage.py runserver]
```

[If it's a Command Line Interface (CLI) application:]
``` # Execute the main script
[e.g., python task/cli.py or python app/main.py]
```
